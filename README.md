# MicroProfile Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the use of MicroProfile technologies for implementing a set of cloud-native microservices. The tutorial is 
made up of a number of Open Liberty Guides each of which demonstrates different MicroProfile technologies. Each Guide is 
designed to be taken independently so if you just want to learn about a specific technology you can just take that guide. If, however, you're goal is to learn about all the MicroProfile capabilities, then working through them in the order shown below is recommended.

## Tutorial Preparation

To save time during the tutorial, it's best to set up your machine beforehand. The instructions below show the pre-requisites to install and how to avoid lengthy downloads.

### Pre-requisites

To use these guides you need the following pre-requisites:
1. A Java 8 JDK (e.g. https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)
1. Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)
1. A git client
1. An editor with Java support (e.g. Eclipse, VS Code, IntelliJ)
1. Docker (Optional - not required for the guides in this tutorial but used in other guides you may wish to try afterwards)

### Downloads

If you will be taking the tutorial at a location with limited network bandwidth, it is recommended you do the following beforehand in order to populate your local .m2 repo and Docker cache (as before, the Docker step is optional).

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/tutorial-microprofile.git
cd tutorial-microprofile
mvn install
docker build -t prime:mym2 .
```

## Introduction

Cloud-native is an approach to application development and deployment.  It's the product of a number of industry movements over the past 10-15 years - agile development practices, DevOps, Microservices and Cloud.  Cloud-native applications are developed using agile practices, use continuous integration/continuous delivery to streamline deployment, are architected around team-aligned microservices, and leverage the cloud for rapid deployment at scale.

When choosing which technologies to use for cloud-native Microservices, the combination of open source and open standards can be very important.  The combination enables a low cost (free) of entry and at the same time avoids being locked in to a single vendor implementation.  

Eclipse MicroProfile is a set of industry specifications for developing and deploying cloud-native Java Microservices.  The specifications address the important challenges of cloud-native microservices, such as toleration of service failures, security, service metrics and health, and more.  Open Liberty is an open source, lightweight, composable Java server that implements the MicroProfile specifications. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to address cloud-native microservice requirements using MicroProfile technology provided by Open Liberty.  The tutorial guices can be taken independently, or in the order they are introduced, below.
